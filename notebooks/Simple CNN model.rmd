    # Goal & Objective

  
**Mission Statement**: The goal of this kernal is help people with zero knowledge of Convolutional Nerual Network (CNN) to leverage the tool and achieve outstanding result.





This kernel is a follow up of my previous [DNN Model Kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/couyang/when-keras-light-shine-in-r-you-shall-have-it-all). This time, I am pushing the model to achieve high accuracy with additional convolutional layers and data augmentation. 

Unlike the traditional kernel masters structure, the most important thing that my models and kernels are focusing on is efficiency. I am trying my best to make the model to be as good as possible with minimal amount of coding.

The purpose of the result is to serve as a benchmark and provide the baseline for further improvement. Moreover, anyone without extensive knowledge in coding can easily read and understand my code. 

That is being said, whoever has any question regarding my code, please leave a comment and I am happy to explain. Lastly, if you like my kernel, please give me a upvote. Thanks!

 

 

## Load packages and data

To set it up on your end, you need to install tensorflow and keras (*install_tensorflow()* & *install_keras()*)

```{r setup, include=T, message = F, warning=F}

set.seed(111)

if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman") 

pacman::p_load(tidyverse, keras, tensorflow)

train <- data.matrix(read.csv("./Downloads/temp/kaggle/digit_recognizer/input/train.csv", header=T))

test <- data.matrix(read.csv("./Downloads/temp/kaggle/digit_recognizer/input/test.csv", header=T))

```



## Preprocess the data



Same process as my last kernal for the following function to_categorical() & normalize() but the dimension of the data need to changed for CNN model. 



```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

train.label<-train[,1] %>% to_categorical()
  
train.feature<-train[,-1] %>% normalize()

test.feature<-test %>% normalize()



dim(train.feature)<-c(nrow(train.feature),28,28,1)

dim(test.feature)<-c(nrow(test.feature),28,28,1)



```



## Building A Simple Convolutional Neural Network



The model is using very basic cnn model with Convolutional layers, Fully Connected layers.



The epochs is only set to be 30 to save time. Push this number higher to run overnight or leverage a GPU to get better result.



One more thing that I added is data augmentation for which shake and alter the picture a little bit to have the machine to learning from different angle to improve accuracy.



```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

model<-keras_model_sequential()



model %>% 

  layer_conv_2d(filters = 32, kernel_size = c(5,5),padding = 'Valid',

                activation = 'relu', input_shape = c(28,28,1))%>%

  layer_batch_normalization()%>%

  layer_conv_2d(filters = 32, kernel_size = c(5,5),padding = 'Same',

                activation = 'relu')%>%

  layer_batch_normalization()%>%

  layer_max_pooling_2d(pool_size = c(2, 2)) %>% 

  layer_dropout(rate = 0.2) %>% 

  

  layer_conv_2d(filters = 64, kernel_size = c(3,3),padding = 'Same',

                activation = 'relu')%>%

  layer_batch_normalization()%>%

  layer_conv_2d(filters = 64, kernel_size = c(3,3),padding = 'Same',

                activation = 'relu')%>%

  layer_batch_normalization()%>%

  layer_max_pooling_2d(pool_size = c(2, 2)) %>% 

  layer_dropout(rate = 0.2) %>%

  

  layer_flatten() %>% 

  layer_dense(units=1024,activation='relu')%>%

  layer_dense(units=512,activation='relu')%>%

  layer_dense(units=256,activation='relu')%>%

  layer_dense(units=10,activation='softmax')

  

 model%>%compile(

  loss='categorical_crossentropy',

  optimizer='adam',

  metrics='accuracy'

)



datagen <- image_data_generator(

  featurewise_center = F,

  samplewise_center=F,

  featurewise_std_normalization = F,

  samplewise_std_normalization=F,

  zca_whitening=F,

  horizontal_flip = F,

  vertical_flip = F,

  width_shift_range = 0.15,

  height_shift_range = 0.15,

  zoom_range = 0.15,

  rotation_range = .15,

  shear_range = 0.15

)





datagen %>% fit_image_data_generator(train.feature)



history<-model %>%

  fit_generator(flow_images_from_data(train.feature, train.label, datagen, batch_size = 64),

                steps_per_epoch = nrow(train.feature)/64, epochs = 30)





```

## Training process visualization

Then, let's plot the training process of the 30 epochs. 



```{r, eval=TRUE, include=TRUE}

plot(history)



```



## Submit the result



As the graph shows, the accuracy has been improving as the epochs increase. I used a very low epochs for this kernel to save time but feel free to bump it up to achieve better result. 



The next step is to predict based on the test dataset and submit



```{r, eval=TRUE, include=TRUE}

pred<-model %>% predict_classes(test.feature,batch_size=64)



cnnsubmission<-data.frame(ImageId=1:nrow(test),Label=pred)



write.csv(cnnsubmission, file="./Downloads/temp/kaggle/digit_recognizer/cnnsubmission.csv", row.names=F)

#save trained model
save_model_hdf5(model,filepath = "./Downloads/temp/kaggle/digit_recognizer/model1.hdf5")
save_model_tfl_hdf5(model,filepath = "./Downloads/temp/kaggle/digit_recognizer/model1.tf")
save_model_weights_hdf5(model,filepath = "./Downloads/temp/kaggle/digit_recognizer/model1_weights.hdf5")


```
